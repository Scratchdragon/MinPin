# MinPin
MinPin (Miniture Package Installer) is a package installation tool with a core focus on cross compatibility, meaning that I make an active effort to make sure packages can be installed on all platforms supported by the tool.

# TODO
(remember to remove this before public github is launched)
	Create alternative zip and unzip packages so that we dont have to rely on other managers
